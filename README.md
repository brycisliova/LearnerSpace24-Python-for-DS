## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: NumPy & DataFrame Operations
- **Objective:** Build proficiency in data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create and manipulate a 2D NumPy array, including extracting key elements, calculating row means, and applying conditional filtering.
  - Implement a custom function to traverse a matrix in spiral order.
  - Work with a video game sales dataset to analyze and visualize sales trends and filter specific game titles like "Grand Theft Auto."
  - Visualize sales data using pie charts and other methods for a better understanding of regional trends.

### Assignment 2: Classification Models
- **Objective:** Develop foundational machine learning models from scratch.
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement a **RandomForestClassifier** on the Iris dataset to understand ensemble learning methods.
  - Build a custom **Logistic Regression** model without scikit-learn for binary classification, using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
  - Test the logistic regression model on a heart disease dataset to evaluate its predictions and accuracy.

### Final Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection and Customer Profiling
- **Objective:** Apply advanced data science techniques to real-world datasets, focusing on fraud detection and customer segmentation.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Fraud Detection:** Use anomaly detection techniques on a credit card dataset with methods like Isolation Forest to detect fraudulent transactions, including visualizing these anomalies.
  - **Customer Profiling:** Segment customers based on their transaction behavior using custom K-Means clustering without scikit-learn, identifying the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method.
  - **Transaction Prediction:** Build a linear regression model to predict transaction amounts based on customer profiles, identifying key predictors.
